## Types of Cyber Threats

### 1. Malware
- Malicious software (e.g., viruses, trojans, ransomware)
- Disrupts, damages, or gains unauthorized access to systems

### 2. Phishing
- Fake emails or messages that trick users into revealing sensitive information

### 3. Denial-of-Service (DoS)
- Overloads a network or system to make it unavailable to users

### 4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

## CIA Triad (Source: GeeksforGeeks)

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in information security:

### 1. Confidentiality
- Ensures data is only accessible to authorized users
- Techniques: Encryption, authentication, access control

### 2. Integrity
- Maintains data accuracy and consistency
- Techniques: Checksums, hashing, version control

### 3. Availability
- Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed
- Techniques: Redundancy, failover, backups
